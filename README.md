# Predicting Loan User Default Risk 

Welcome to my repository! 

In this project, I plan to explore a dataset of over 200,000 loan users in India by performing data analysis and using machine-learning tools. This dataset is from Kaggle user Subham Surana's "Loan Prediction Based on Customer Behavior" (link below under 'Sources' subtitle). Each observation in this dataset contains information like the loan user's income, profession, years of experience in current job, state/city, and, what I'm interested in predicting, whether they were flagged for potentially defaulting on the loan. Ultimately, I seek to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a loan user is flagged. Note, that this dataset was originally provided for a hackathon organized by Univ.AI.
